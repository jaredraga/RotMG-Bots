# Generating names by joining two words together from the dictionary.

# Rules:
# 1. Combined words mustn't exceed 10 letters

# Wtf!? It worked on the first try

# Later...
# As it turned out, there are a lot of boring words in the English Dictionary
# So it looks like we won't be using this code after all. LMAO
